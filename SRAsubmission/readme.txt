This directory holds two example files that were used in a previous SRA submission. 
I recommend following the submission wizard located here: https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/subs/sra/

This will lead you through a multi-step process so that others will be able to access your data and 
be able to understand what samples the sequences came from.

Tab. Description
1. Submitter - Information about you
2. General Info - Determine if you need a new BioProject and BioSamples
3. Project Info - Information to be included about the BioProject on the SRA website
4. BioSample Type - Information collected to help you fill out the appropriate biosample attributes file
5. BioSample Attributes - Upload the attributes file
6. SRA metadata - Upload a metadata file (similar to a Qiime manifest file) that indicates which samples are associated with which file names
7. File - Upload the sequence (fastq) files to the database

Then you are ready to submit everything.

Example files are also included here:

BioSample attributes - Metagenome.environmental.1.0.txt
SRA metadata - SRA_metadata.xlsx
